		<p>Hello! S.P.I.T. E-cell now owns a website!
		This year we've worked really hard to put ecell back on its track in our college. We've received an
		overwhelming response and we're glad that the idea of entrepreneurship is still alive within our very own
		college engineers. And we hope that the excitement stays the same always!
		Special thanks to the E-cell team for thinking out of the box!</br>
